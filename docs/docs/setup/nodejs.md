# NodeJS

## Installing Node.js LTS

To get started, you'll need to install Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) on your machine. Follow the instructions below for your operating system.

### macOS

1. Visit the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Click on the "Download" button for the LTS version.
3. Once the download is complete, open the package installer and follow the installation wizard.
4. After the installation is finished, open the Terminal and proceed to the "Verifying the Installation" section.

### Windows

1. Visit the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Click on the "Download" button for the LTS version.
3. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the installation wizard.
4. Make sure to select the option to add Node.js to the PATH environment variable during the installation process.
5. After the installation is finished, open the Command Prompt and proceed to the "Verifying the Installation" section.

## Verifying the Installation

To verify that Node.js is installed correctly and working, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).
2. Type the following command and press Enter:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

This command will display the installed version of Node.js. If the installation was successful, you should see the version number, such as:

   ```
   v18.16.0
   ```

3. Next, type the following command and press Enter:

   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

   This command will display the installed version of npm (Node Package Manager), which comes bundled with Node.js. If the installation was successful, you should see the version number, such as:

   ```
   9.5.1
   ```

If both commands display the respective version numbers without any errors, congratulations! You have successfully installed Node.js LTS on your machine, and it is working correctly.

You are now ready to start using Node.js for your development projects. Happy coding!
