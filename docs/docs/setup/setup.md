# Setup Overview

Welcome to the Setup Guides section! This area contains detailed instructions on setting up various development tools that are essential for modern software development. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, these guides will help you get your environment ready for coding efficiently.

## What’s Inside

Below are the tools we've covered with step-by-step installation and configuration instructions:

### [Node.js](./nodejs.md)
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, and is essential for developing applications using frameworks like Express.js and for working with tools like npm.

### [Visual Studio Code](./vscode.md)
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop. It comes with support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and features.

### [Postman](./postman.md)
Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster.

## Getting Started

To make the most out of these guides, follow the instructions in the order presented and ensure your system meets all the required prerequisites specified in each guide. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to ask for help (ping us on discord!!) or search for solutions online (you's strong and independent yes).

## Conclusion

Setting up your development environment properly is the first step toward a successful coding journey. These guides aim to provide you with a smooth setup process for each tool, ensuring that you can focus on what's important: building great software.
