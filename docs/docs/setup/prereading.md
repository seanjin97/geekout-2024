# Pre-reading

## Backend
Same thing as the frontend workshop, you'll need some pre-knowledge of javascript!

## Frontend

We will be going over the basics of the popular frontend development framework React during the Geekout frontend workshop. In preparation, it would be good if you have at least some idea of what HTML, CSS, and Javascript are. We won't be focusing much on HTML and CSS - it's more important to get a basic idea of Javascript syntax so you can look at code and not be totally lost. 

If you want a step by step detailed video tutorial (there are many online), you could watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks0Z_qP2WEk. 

Alternatively you could work through this: https://betterexplained.com/articles/the-single-page-javascript-overview/,  and google for the parts you don't understand. These should be relatively concise and suitable for you if you already know the basics of some other programming language. 

[Optional] If you already know the basics of Javascript and have not yet learnt React, and want to learn something more advanced, you could watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m55PTVUrlnA.
