Data persistence - relational data vs non-relational data

everything is JSON in the end. but your relational database you need go study how to design it. that's another whole painful chapter to go through.

Can demo but don’t need them to do. Maybe can put into the advanced section in the docusaurs also
Non-relational data can demo mongodb or whatever non relational nonsense la it’s json

Relational database - serializes to JSON

baseline, you can use relational databases for everything. non-relational yucks.
