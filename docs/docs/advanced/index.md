# Backend Advanced

<small>_hello i guess you are here cuz the basics were too ez for u. feel free to read this section and have a go at it during the workshop, don't need listen if u don't wanna. but help ur team if they need help yea._</small>

## About

In this section, we'll cover more good practices and additional features to give your API more flavour. (yummy). It builds onto the stuff covered in the [Backend Basics](../basics/index.md) section.

**TLDR if you skipped past the Basics sections**: We created a CRUD Todo list API server using Express.js.

The advanced sections are **not ordered**! So you can **pick and choose any section** to start with first! There're code checkpoints at each section where you can download the necessary code to get started for that section.

Ya it might get overwhelming, like why even need to have testing, why need authentication, why need to do this do that. it's too many things for 1 person to do. But just do it for funsies and for practice. It's purely optional. Do it at your own pace or work together with your groupmates for this.

There'll be less handholding here, so just chatgpt or google search whatever you don't understand or ask in the [# backend-workshop](https://discord.com/channels/1224913680689266749/1224920594408144928) channel anytime (even 2am).

Have fun!

## Challenges

You might realise that there're mini challenges (or maybe not so mini) scattered around (mainly the [Testing](./testing.md), [Hosting](./hosting.md), [Security](./auth.md), [Database](./database.md) sections). These challenges are optional. Try them out if you're interested!

<small>_also no prizes just fyi. but you get a bigger brain. a person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts._</small>

Feel free to post your questions on discord too!

**aight let's get to it.**
