# Backend Advanced

<small>_hello i guess you are here cuz the basics were too ez for u. feel free to read this section and have a go at it during the workshop, don't need listen if u don't wanna. but help ur team if they need help yea._</small>

## About the Advanced section

In this section, we'll cover more good practices and additional features to give your API more flavour. (yummy).

Ya it might get overwhelming, like why even need to have testing, why need authentication, why need to do this do that. it's too many things for 1 person to do.

But just do it for funsies and for practice. Do it at your own pace and work together with your group mates for this.

There'll be less handholding here, so just chatgpt or google search whatever you don't understand or ask the facilitators in person.

Have fun!

## Challenges

You might realise that there're mini challenges (or maybe not so mini) scattered around (mainly the [Testing](./testing.md), [Hosting](./hosting.md), [Security](./auth.md), [Database](./database.md) sections). These challenges are optional. Try them out if you're interested!

<small>_also no prizes just fyi. but you get a bigger brain. a person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts._</small>

Feel free to ask questions in the [# backend-workshop](https://discord.com/channels/1224913680689266749/1224920594408144928) channel anytime. (even at 2am).
