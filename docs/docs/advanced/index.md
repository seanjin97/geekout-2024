# Advanced

<small>_hello i guess you are here cuz the basics were too ez for u. feel free to read this section and have a go at it during the workshop, don't need listen if u don't wanna. but help ur team if they need help yea._</small>

In this section, we'll cover more good practices and additional features to give your API more flavour. (yummy).

Ya it might get overwhelming, like why even need to have testing, why need authentication, why need to do this do that. it's too many things for 1 person to do.

But just do it for funsies and for practice.

There'll be less handholding here, so just chatgpt or google search whatever you don't understand or ask the facilitators in person.

<small>_aight let's get to it._</small>
