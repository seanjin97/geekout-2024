Put auth lor

In order from easy to tedious

Got basic auth, api key auth, token based auth

these are security measures you can do to protect your APIs and data. but your server is still hit regardless, how can we protect the server itself.

what if we can have a security layer that is separate from your application. 
attackers have to go through that layer before they hit your application, thus fully protecting your application that's cloud architecture solutioning. 
it's rlly fun. go take AWS cloud certification.
