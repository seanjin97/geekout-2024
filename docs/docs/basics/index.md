# Basics

## What You Will Be Creating

In this Node.js Express workshop, you will be creating a simple Todo List API using the Express framework. This project will give you hands-on experience with building a RESTful API and understanding the basics of Node.js and Express.

The Todo List API will allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todo items. The API will be built using Node.js and Express, and it will not use a database for simplicity. Instead, we will store the todo items in memory.

## Learning Outcomes
1. How to create an Express API server from scratch.
2. Understand project setup and dependencies.
3. How to properly design REST API endpoints.
4. Understand what a client and server is.
