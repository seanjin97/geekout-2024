# 1.5 Challenge/Bonus

This part purely serves as a further challenge to those who already finished the previous checkpoints or already know React. The task is to add an additional button next to the delete button to create a duplicate/copy of the todo list item. 

**Some hints:**
1. Create the button and the `copyTodoItem` function triggered by `onClick`. What API endpoint should the function call?
2. How do we update the state of the `Todo` component to add the copied item to the list?
