# Frontend

## What You Will Be Learning

In this React workshop, you will be learning how to build a simple Todo App frontend which performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todo items. 

## Setup/Git Instructions

1. We will be providing you with the Github link to clone our repository. Alternatively, you can also download the repository and unzip it from discord. 
2. We will be guiding you through the code via step-by-step exercises. Make sure you have git installed in your machine. At each stage of the code, you can check out by running `git checkout {checkpoint branch name}`. For example, before exercise two, run `git checkout checkpoint2` (for checkpoint 2). 

This is called checking out a branch. To save your code within a branch, run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "add changes"
```

The first command allows you to choose the files you want to commit to the branch. `.` just means you are commiting all files. The second command commits the changes to the branch with a message "add changes". You can write any message for your commit.

After you committed your code in that branch you can proceed to checkout another branch.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Basic React, components, props
2. Making API requests to the backend
3. UseState and useEffect hooks
